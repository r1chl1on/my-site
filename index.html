<h1>Welcome.I see you have found my site!</h1>
  <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>My name is r1chl1on and I am an average boy from a village in a very small country.</p>
  
  <h2>Why are YOU here.</h2>
  <p>You are here because 
  1- I know you and have sent you this site's link. 
  Or
  2- You have found my site in a diffrent mysterius way.</p>
 
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I was born in 20th of May 2007. Depending on when you are seeing this my actual age may vary.
  In the making of this site which is excactly 01/02/2022 or 1st of February 2022 I am 14 years old.</p>
 
 
 <p>I don't actually want to become a game dev, programmer or do anything tech related. I would like to become an actor.
 But the ideal proffesion for me would be a youtuber. But I've come to realise it will never happen
 The success rate of becoming a youtuber in America is already low. In my country they are close to none.</p>
 
 
 <h3>What is this site for</h3>
 
 <p> This site is for personal use mainly, but I would like to share it with my friends and other people around me.</p>
